                <p> <img src="assets/images/IMG_E0425.JPG">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of
                    the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
                    since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable EnglishThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                    slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
                    isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>
